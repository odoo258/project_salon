Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Medicaments that are not in any pricelist cannot be added to the cart.
Make sure to select at least 'Different prices per customer segment' in
Sales -> Settings -> Sale Price. Then add that medicament to a pricelist
so it can be added to the cart when that pricelist is currently active.
